Hints on making and installing the AKSL C++ software library.
This file is WORK IN PROGRESS.
I'll write a better installation manual some day.

Create the rendezvous directory.

The rendezvous directory is typically a directory like ~/pub,
which can be used for installing AKSL-related software so that
it can be used by AKSL application software packages.

Set the shell environment variable SDIR to the rendezvous directory.

setenv SDIR ~/pub

The makefile will create subdirectories such as the following.

$SDIR/bin
$SDIR/include
$SDIR/include/aksl
$SDIR/lib
$SDIR/src
$SDIR/src/aksl
$SDIR/src/aksl/include
$SDIR/src/aksl/include/aksl

The AKSL software will be installed into these directories.
The command "make rvdirs" creates these directories.
But you don't have to do that because the "install" target calls "rvdirs".

If more than one person will be creating AKSL application software packages,
it may be more convenient to have a common area such as
/usr/local/aksl instead of ~/pub for the rendezvous directory.

===============================================================================
Type "make" to create the file "libaksl.a".

This will create a subdirectory "work" in the AKSL source directory.

Any error messages or warnings are written to file "errorfile".

Type "make install" to install the library file libaksl.a,
the header files and the source files to the rendezvous directory.
